            John glanced over at Rachelâ€™s peaceful sleeping figure. His heart still skipped
             a few beats as his eyes covered every inch of her shadowy silhouette, pausing only
             when he reached her face. Clear porcelain skin, illuminated by the light coming
             from a nearby window gave her an almost angelic appearance. She looked so peaceful...

      <h1> What is Choose to Create About? </h1>
      <h2>"It is our choices that show what we truly are far more than our abilities."</h2>
      <p>
        Choose to create was inspired by all the writing prompt journals floating around in all of
        the book stores and gift shops of the world. I always picked those books up thinking
        they were a great idea. I then put them down thinking I could find the same thing on
        the internet for free.
            </p>
        <p>
          Choose to create is a website with free unlimited access to all the writing prompts your
          heart desires.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea behind the brand name "choose to create" is to inspire people to create rather
          than consume. We consume everyday, what is 20 minutes of creating going to hurt?
        </p>
        <p>
          Write out on your computer or get old school (which is my favorite) and grab that journal
          you bought years ago with hopes of a new writing habbit, and get to writing :).
        </p>
        <p>
          Enjoy Creating!
