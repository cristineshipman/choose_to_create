          <h1><strong>Story of the Day</strong></h1>
          <h4>This story is taken from the top of the subreddit r/bestofWritingPrompts</h4>
          <h4><strong>Prompt:</strong> A master and his dog.</h4>
          <div class="top-story">
            <p>
              The Master lifted his cane off of his throne in the room of gathering,
              leaned on it. He moved carefully, slowly to the glowing box in one
              corner of the room. He pressed a thin finger against the side of the
              box, and the glowing disappeared.
            </p>
             <p>
               I stood up to greet him as he turned to me. I looked up at his eyes.
              They were losing their color. Most Masters think dogs don't notice
              things, but I do. I have been a good dog to my Master, and I have
              noticed many things.
              <p>
               I noticed when he was not moving in his bed one morning. I noticed
               when another Master was going to attack mine from behind. I noticed
               when my Master brought home a new, tiny Master with no motor skills
                and a high-pitched squeal.
              </p>
               "George, ya ole mutt," my Master chuckled, reaching down to scratch
               my neck. I loved it when he scratched my neck!

               As he pulled his hand back, I looked back into his eyes and tilted my head.

            <div class="about">
              <p>
                Choose to create was inspired by all the writing prompt journals floating around in all of
                the book stores and gift shops of the world (like the one pictured). I always picked those books up thinking
                they were a great idea. I then put them down thinking I could find the same thing on
                the internet for free.
              </p>
              <p>
                Choose to create is a website with free unlimited access to all the writing prompts your
                heart desires. The prompts are taken from the subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/"
                   target="_blank">Writing Prompts</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                The idea behind the brand name "choose to create" is to inspire people to choose to be creaters over
                consumers.
              </p>

                Type out your stories on your computer or get old school (which is my favorite) and grab that journal
                you bought years ago with hopes of a new writing habbit, and get to writing :).
